System changes
<hr>

<ul align="left">
	<li>
		Mouse control is now available, functioning quite similarly to the flight controls in ArmA 3
	</li>
	<li>
		A virtual soundscape has been added; you can now hear some synthesized sounds of enemy engines, gunfire, and missiles
	</li>
	<li>
		All models have been scaled up by 1.6-2.215x to provide more realistic proportions to the metric system used by Unity
	</li>
	<li>
		Damage, shield, mass and thrust values have been standardised across the board.
		<ul><li class="small">The player used to have 6 shields and 6 hull, going up against shots that did 1 damage<br>
		On the other hand, enemy assets had within the realm of 40-200hp, going up against shots that did 12-24 damage<br>
		Now the Altus has 150 shields and 150 hull, serving as a standard for other hp values to be based on</ul></li>
	</li>
	<li>
		Collision damage is now properly based on alignment of velocity with collider normals- you come out much better from scraping an enemy transport
		 at similar velocity than flying head first into an asteroid
	</li>
	<li>
		Missile locking now has a visual indicator on the HUD- a white circle that closes around the target until it reaches minimum size and turns red
		(the lock tone is still in game, this indicator just makes things clearer)
	</li>
	
	<li>
		All shot models have been replaced, also now featuring trails with consistent lengths
	</li>
	<li>
		A shifting world origin has been introduced
		<ul><li class="small">Previously, when at positions of great magnitude(e.g. 5km away from world origin), objects would appear to oscillate due to<br>
		floating point position imprecision, this should no longer occur</li>
		<li class = "small">Because of this, maps introduced in future updates can be made larger</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		The render pipeline has been changed to URP- things look shinier now, and I generally prefer the look
	</li>
</ul>
<hr>
Main Menu
<hr>
<div>
	
	<ul align="left">
		<li>
			The scene has been totally remade to accomodate to scale models
		</li>
		<li>
			Added the field manual to the main menu. Here you can find info about controls, mechanics, and ships you will see in the field
		</li>
		<li>
			Added the Chandrasekhar Battlecruiser and Excavator B.6 into the fully revised main menu scene, where they can be seen towards the end of the animation
		</li>
		<li>
			Collision damage is now properly based on alignment of velocity with collider normals- you come out much better from scraping an enemy transport
			 at similar velocity than flying head first into an asteroid
		</li>
		<li>
			Updated the logo
		</li>
		<li>
			In general the remade menu scene has been expanded greatly, as has the animation sequence
		</li>
	</ul>
	


<hr>
<i>Altus F.2</i><br>
<p>REDFORS STRIKE FIGHTER</p>
<hr>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		Thrust to weight ratio has been buffed- there should be a noticeable increase in responsiveness
	</li>
	<li>
		Laser cannons have received substantial buffs
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li class="small">
			They can now fire in full-auto
		</li>
		<li class="small">
			Muzzle velocity has been increased from 200->300ms^-1
		</li>
		<li class="small">
			The laser cannons now automatically adjust their facing to converge at the range the target is at, allowing for more consistent damage output
		</li>
		<li class="small">
			Capacitor energy has been increased, with max capacity at maintenance level being increased from 500->600, and the capacity at
			emergency power being increased from 1000->1300. This means you can fire off more shots in succession, especially with power
			diverted to weapons
		</li>
		
	</ul>
	<li>
		Model changes
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li class="small">
			The model is now symmetrical, boasts greater detail, has larger laser cannons, and is shaded smoothly. The shading change might be reverted
			since the old look did have a certain charm to it
		</li>
		<li class="small">
			Added a targeting camera to the cockpit/HUD, alongside data about the target including 'health' values, target type, and relative velocity
		</li>
		<li class="small">
			Canopy superstructure has been added which houses a rearview mirror with a PIP display
		</li>
		<li class="small">
			Added a new shield display sprite (no more legacy sprite showing gunpods even if they aren't mounted)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		HEP Missiles can now be dumbfired by pressing DELETE without a lock- this isn't realistic, but they do more damage when fired this way
	</li>
	<li>
		A searchlight has been added which can be toggled with ;
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li class="small">It's handy for navigating the dark areas found inside asteroids and throughout Course 1 and Mission 2
	</ul>
</ul>

<hr>
<i>Falchion-Class</i><br>
<p>REDFORS LIGHT CARRIER</p>
<hr>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		Point defence cannons have been added to the carrier which fire on small threats within a 800m radius. These can include fighters, sensor probes, 
		incoming munitions, and smaller transports
	</li>
	<li>
		The docking warnings now give directions to the player such as 'YAW LEFT', 'PITCH DOWN', 'POSITION UP' or 'POSITION RIGHT'
	</li>
	<li>
		Like the Altus, the model is now shaded smoothly. On top of this, some face normals have been corrected so there's no longer a chipped looking
		communications array
	</li>
</ul>
<hr>
+ <i>Excavator</i> B.6<br>
<p>REDFORS BOMBER</p>
<hr>
A bomber with a reverse delta wing design, stocked with missile launchers and plenty of other hardpoints
<p>(planned to be playable in next update)</p>

<hr>
G-110 Transport<br>
<p>GRENFORS TRANSPORT</p>
<hr>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		The turrets now have limited travesal zones, but have more accurate tracking otherwise
	</li>
</ul>
<hr>
N-163 <i><b>'Asag'</b></i><br>
<p>GRENFORS LIGHT FIGHTER</p>
<hr>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		This pesky little light fighter should be less of an issue to catch now, seeing nerfs to its thrust to weight ratio and some AI fixes<br>
		<p>(it still has higher TWR than the Altus F.2, but only at full thrust which it can only pull out for a few seconds before overheating)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Model has seen more major design changes in terms of texturing
	</li>
	<li>
		The AI now attempts to evade obstacles other than the player, this includes an ability to navigate tunnel-like geometry
	</li>
</ul>
<hr>
+ <i><b>Chandrasekhar</b></i><br>
<p>GRENFORS BATTLECRUISER</p>
<hr>
A 1.6km long monster, it boasts an unfathomable array of firepower.<br>
It's present in the menu scene and hidden in one of the missions. For now, it can fire its wing mounted cannons and defend itself with point defence
cannons, but it will not move for any reason, and it is impervious to damage.
<br>
<hr>
Test Mission 1<br>
<hr>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		More probes have been added to compensate for the carrier's point defence cannons joining in on the fun
	</li>
	<li>
		An optional task has been added for destroying all enemy fighters
	</li>
	<li>
		2 more transports have been added to the convoy
	</li>
</ul>
<hr>
+ Test Mission 2<br>
<hr>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		The stage is set for the neutralisation of an enemy mining operation in deep space; the light carrier 'Nomad' and its complement of strike craft 
		attempt to sabotage the defences of an asteroid base to allow the  frigates 'Red Shade' and 'Defiant' to attack.
	</li>
	<li>
		An Altus fighter will clear the way for an Excavator bomber, packed with volatile ordnance, to navigate through the asteroid base and destroy anything 
		necessary to maintain the mass driver array
	</li>
	<li>
		As 'Nomad' approaches the base, an energy reading is picked up that starts to exceed that of the base's reactor...
	</li>
</ul>
<br>
<hr>
Basic Training<br>
<hr>
+ The tutorial has been improved in general, including improved hint clarity, the player being warned if they accidentally<br>
turn off TRIM or the stabiliser, and a hologram attached to the carrier rack to help the player dock for the first time<br>
<br>
<hr>
+ Course 1<br>
<hr>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		 A more basic course level with larger waypoint rings and less requirement for speed control or stabiliser toggling
	</li>
</ul>
<hr>
Course 2<br>
<hr>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		This already existing intermediate course has been renamed to Course 2
	</li>
	<li>
		Checkpoint start locations have been improved
	</li>
	<li>
		New obstacles have been added to the scene, with a revamped asteroid field
	</li>
</ul>
<hr>
+ Course 3<br>
<hr>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		An advanced course level inspired by the attack on Death Star II in RotJ
	</li>
	<li>
		Requires use of every advanced control technique to get through the 16km diameter battlestation
	</li>
</ul>
<hr>
Misc.<br>
<hr>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		The callsign system has been partially implemented
		<ul><li class="small">You earn a callsign after meeting the prerequisites to start field missions- this is displayed in the main menu for now, 
		but it will change voice lines in the future (currently, the player is always referred to as 'Rake')</li>
		<li class="small">Callsigns and the ways to obtain them include:<br><br>
		<b>[<i> RAKE </i>]</b><br>
		Destroy every target in a VR mission<br><br>
		[<i> BOUNDER </i>]<br>
		Friendly fire<br><br>
		[<i> CRUSADER </i>]<br>
		Refuse to use missiles and make gun kills against fighters<br><br>
		[<i> DEADPAN</i>]<br>
		Don't make substantial contributions to the other callsigns
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Added polymorphism to classes behind the scenes, following a proper course I did to learn C++ and object oriented standards
	</li>
	<li>
		And various little optimisations, load times should be quicker in general, but the new renderer and higher object and effect counts hurt GPU usage quite a lot
	</li>
