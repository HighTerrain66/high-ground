Summary
<hr>
The main goals of this update were to bring different playable ships into the game, and to optimise my codebase with lessons 
I'd learned from my UE4 work. If I could accomplish that, working online multiplayer in down the line might become a real and exciting possibility.

After 4 months of work, I've just about finished with it, on top of some extra improvements. After overhauling almost the entire codebase, every existing ship
had their HP and movement mechanics standardised under the umbrella of 'BaseAsset', bringing parity between AI entities and the player ship in functionality.
The new AI behaviour for FighterAssets took 
a much faster pace
<br>


<hr>
System changes
<hr>

<ul align="left">
	<li>
		AI controlled ships now work with the same mechanics as player ships, and vice versa
		<ul><li class="small">As a result, previously AI-only ships can now be player controlled. On top of the Altus, 3 more playable ships are now available</li>
		<li class="small">In some missions, you can take control of AI allies after death to carry on the fight</li>
		</ul>
		
	</li>
	<li>
		Fighter AI has been overhauled- I believe this new behaviour is more fun and realistic, but they can have a tendency to spin off into the distance when trying
		to take advantage of the stabiliser, and are generally place their shots much less accurately than before.
	</li>
	<li>
		Separate physics mechanics have been added to captial ships to allow them to move around freely at last
	</li>
	<li>
		A new mission ranking system has been introduced- push your skills to the limit to get an S-Rank in your favourite missions!
	</li>
	
</ul>
<hr>
Main Menu
<hr>
<div>
	
	<ul align="left">
		<li>
			Descriptions for different buttons are displayed when hovering over them, letting you know what you're getting into before you press one
		</li>
		<li>
			An options menu has been added where graphics quality presets can be selected,
			and different control presets can be opted into (Keyboard + Mouse, Gamepad + Keyboard, Flight Stick + Keyboard)
			<ul><li class="small">()</li></ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			An Estoc-Class Frigate has been added to the menu scene
		</li>
		
		
	</ul>
	


<hr>
<i>Altus F.2</i><br>
<p>REDFORS STRIKE FIGHTER</p>
<hr>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		SGP Gunpods are now available for installation in the hangar, providing high velocity firepower with a serious wallop
		<ul><li class="small">They require some time to manually charge before firing, and once charged, they automatically fire after a fixed delay</li>
		<li class="small">Coming from this charge time are two lightning fast beams that deal 10x the damage of the Altus' integrated guns</li>
		<li class="small">Unlike HEP missiles, they draw from the Altus' replenishing store of weapon energy and do not require reloading trips for repeat firing</li>
		<li class="small">They can be fired in tandem with integrated weaponry, quickly cashing out on stored weapon energy for massive damage</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Integrated Laser cannons have been further buffed to keep up with the increased pace of fighter on fighter combat
	<ul>
		<li class="small">
			Muzzle velocity has been increased from 300->550ms^-1
		</li>	
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		HEP Missiles
		<ul>
		<li class="small">
			A longtime bug causing HEP Missile starting velocity to be slower than the launching ship has been fixed
		</li>
		<li class="small">
			As a result, they boast quicker kill times and increased range
		</li>
		<li class="small">
			Explosion SFX have finally been added
		</li>
		<li class="small">
			The collider is extended when at very high speeds, to increase consistency of collisions
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<i>Falchion-Class</i><br>
<p>REDFORS LIGHT CARRIER</p>
<hr>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		Point defence cannons now have firing SFX, and are more beastly than ever before
		<ul>
		<li class="small">
			Firing range buffed from 800->1000m
		</li>
	</li>
</ul>
<hr>
+ <i>Excavator</i> B.6<br>
<p>REDFORS BOMBER</p>
<hr>
A bomber with a reverse delta wing design, stocked with 12 missile launchers and plenty of other hardpoints<br>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		Featured in the new missions 'Asag Defence' and 'Strike', being a playable asset in the latter
	</li>
</ul>
<hr>
+ <i>Estoc-Class</i> B.6<br>
<p>REDFORS Destroyer</p>
<hr>
A 675m long Capital Ship, bringing extensive firepower to <b>A.W.E</b> missions where the ordnance of a light carrier doesn't cut it, and subtlety is less of a requirement<br>

<hr>
N-163 <i><b>'Asag'</b></i><br>
<p>GRENFORS LIGHT FIGHTER</p>
<hr>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		The Asag now works much the same as the Altus under the hood, but still lacks any manual power management, loadout options or shielding.
	</li>
	<li>
		Laser Cannons have been buffed
		<ul>
		<li class="small">
			Muzzle velocity has been increased from 200->400ms^-1
		</li>
		<li class="small">
			A visible lead indicator in the HUD helps the Asag to track fast moving targets
		</li>
		<li class="small">
			Firing SFX have been added
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	
</ul>
<hr>
<i><b>Chandrasekhar</b></i><br>
<p>GRENFORS BATTLECRUISER</p>
<hr>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		If 
	</li>

	
</ul>
<br>

<hr>
+ Asag Defence<br>
<hr>
A new mission flown from the GRENFORS side
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		A REDFORS strike group tracks down the <i>Chandrasekhar</i> Battlecruiser, but its vast complement of N-163 <i><b>'Asag'</b></i> fighters won't easily allow a handful of hapless bombers with a pitiful escort make their mark on the pride of the fleet...
	</li>
</ul>

<hr>
Tutorial<br>
</hr>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		Hints have been rewritten for clarity, and previous hints can be viewed by cycling through them with the arrow keys
	</li>
	<li>
		VR Targets have been made larger
	</li>
</ul>

<hr>
Course 3<br>
<hr>
<ul align="left">
	<li>
		Added the CRISIS timer- destroy the station's reactor in 3 minutes, or face the opened gates of hell.
	</li>
	<li>
		The surface turrets have been made more dangerous, adding more peril to the initial approach. In general, flying through the cover of the trench is much more encouraged. 
		<ul>
		<li class="small">
			Buffed tower turret shot velocity from 600->850ms^-1
		</li>
		<li class="small">
			Buffed small turret reloading time from 0.5s to 0.25s
		</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

</ul>
